Let's walk through a dry run of the `minOperations` method of the `Solution` class with an example input to understand how it works.

Consider the following example input:
```java
String[] logs = {"d1/", "d2/", "../", "d21/", "./"};
```

Here's the step-by-step execution of the code:

1. Initialize `ans` to 0.

2. Iterate through each element in `logs`:
   - For `log = "d1/"`:
     - It's not `./` and not `../`, so increment `ans` by 1.
     - `ans` becomes 1.
   - For `log = "d2/"`:
     - It's not `./` and not `../`, so increment `ans` by 1.
     - `ans` becomes 2.
   - For `log = "../"`:
     - It's not `./`, so decrement `ans` by 1 (but ensure `ans` is at least 0).
     - `ans` becomes 1.
   - For `log = "d21/"`:
     - It's not `./` and not `../`, so increment `ans` by 1.
     - `ans` becomes 2.
   - For `log = "./"`:
     - It's `./`, so continue to the next iteration without changing `ans`.

3. Return the final value of `ans`, which is 2.

So, the method would return `2` for this example input, indicating that you would need to perform 2 operations to return to the main folder.
